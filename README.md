# Mimik

Simulate being a service (or many) in a mesh.

Helpful to test Istio features like traffic routing, tracing, security and more.

## Introduction

Basically what Mimik does is to imitate a service that listens to certain paths and methods, and connects these with upstream connections (that usually are Mimik instances too) forming a service mesh.

## Getting started

Mimik instances run on Kubernetes clusters. The easiest way to create them is with Mimik operator. Check the [documentation](https://github.com/leandroberetta/mimik-operator) to install it. 

## Hello World

The following example will deploy a minimal mesh based on two services, a frontend and a backend and also configure Istio basic resources to expose the frontend: 

```yaml
apiVersion: mimik.veicot.io/v1alpha1
kind: Mimik
metadata:
  name: hello-world-frontend-v1
  namespace: hello-world
spec:
  service: hello-world-frontend
  version: v1
  endpoints:
    - path: /
      method: GET
      connections:
        - service: hello-world-backend
          port: 8080
          path: hello
          method: GET
---      
apiVersion: mimik.veicot.io/v1alpha1
kind: Mimik
metadata:
  name: hello-world-backend-v1
  namespace: hello-world
spec:
  service: hello-world-backend
  version: v1
  endpoints:
    - path: /hello
      method: GET
      connections: []
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: hello-world
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway
  servers:
    - port:
        number: 80
        name: http
        protocol: HTTP
      hosts:
        - "*"
---
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: hello-world
spec:
  hosts:
    - "*"
  gateways:
    - hello-world
  http:
    - route:
        - destination:
            host: hello-world-ui
            port:
              number: 8080
```

After a few requests, the following topology can be seen in the graph generated by Kiali:
